As what is said in the title, for a very cheap price I can do a stream overlay for you guys. The money will definitely help me since I am currently having a hardtime trying to save some money to buy myself a new laptop for school since my current laptop is about to give up on me and the best thing I can do is do a lot of commissioned works to get myself a new one.

17,Elgato Wave 3 and Background Noise Mitigation,1,wp0k9j,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/wp0k9j/elgato_wave_3_and_background_noise_mitigation/,0,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

I was just about to buy the Wave 3. I've watched a lot of reviews, tests, etc, and feel like it's what I need, but the whole ""background noise"" thing is confusing to me.

&#x200B;

Everyone says condenser mics pick up background noise easily. But I watched a reviewer plug in and use 4 different USB mics, including the Wave 3, out of the box (no software help or editing, which was the point of the whole thing) and I couldn't hear any background noise, despite his claims that he had his AC on and a fan, not to mention his computer fans.

&#x200B;

I do not typically have an AC or a fan running, just my computer. But I am worried about keyboard/mouse clicking. I've seen reviews that show their mic sitting on their desk right between their keyboard and mouse, and swear with the angle it's tilted at that it doesn't pick up the keyboard or mouse. I understand that the Wave 3 primarily wants audio from the front and tries to reject more from the side and back, but am curious to hear how background noise from computer fans to keyboards have been for those who use the Wave 3.

&#x200B;

I am also worried about my BF's talking. We game together in the same groups. My mic would be about 5-6 feet away from him (he uses a headset), and he's off to my left as opposed to behind me. He's not a loud talker and doesn't talk all that much during the games we play, but I'm wondering how difficult of a time I will have combating that.

&#x200B;

And because I know someone will ask: I don't want an XLR because this is just a hobby and I don't have the time or money to invest into that kind of quality right now. The Wave 3 sounds good for its price point and the software seems really effective and easy to use.

I just picked up a Rode Podmic and Elgato Wave XLR for gaming/recording clips. I've scoured google/youtube on how to optimize this thing, but I feel like my audio is not where it should be. I'm having two main problems.

1. I'm very quiet... I would like the mic to be kinda far from my face so it's not in the way while I'm gaming. Right now I have it positioned about halfway between my monitor and my face and off to the right. I feel like I need to turn my gain up to counter this (see 2).
2. There is a static-like popping sound that I can hear when my input gain is too high and even when it's low enough to prevent the static sound, I can still hear the static when I talk. Is this common? How can I prevent this so I can crank up the gain a little more?

I think both of them are beautiful to look at.  I know many will argue that the visual look of a microphone shouldn't be my concern, only how it actually sounds, which is of course true, but I can't help it.  I'm vain.  I want it to look nice, just like all the other gear I choose.  And of course it will be seen on screen.

Of course, I do want clear, crisp, clean sound.  That's huge for me.  I know people can always forgive bad visuals as long as the sound is clean, but still, the look is important for me.

The problem I do want to avoid is the dreaded plosives, but I don't want to use a foam wind cover or pop filter of any kind.  They just look so ugly to me, and will of course fully or partly cover this beautiful microphone, and it just kills me.

Do you think I can use the microphone without covering it up?

(I'll be using an Elgato Wave XLR interface)

I know both microphones apparently have a pop filter and shock mount built in, so theoretically, I wouldn't need these any way, however, I hear some people say it is not enough.

I did see one hack where a guy opens up the Procaster (the front unscrews) and he simply adds more foam inside to really deaden any plosives.  

However, I am leaning more toward the Podmic as it is smaller and easier to manoeuvre on its hinge bracket (my desk and set up is very small with limited space to move).  However, the front of the Podmic doesn't open, so I can't perform the hack on it.

I am in a real dilemma as to what to do.

today i'd like to talk about a product that nobody talks about here yet and that seems to me to be promising for the last generation video game console streaming.

I want to talk about the Yamaha ZG01 mixer. It is currently the only one that offers to connect your console directly to HDMI to extract the sound!

https://preview.redd.it/10hyy362ufh91.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf7e18692634b81add986bca7b05857ad034935a

No need to use an audio extractor or an HDMI splitter with toslink or 3.5mm mini jack output.

You have 2 HDMI inputs for audio and an HDMI output to get the video and audio stream to your TV / PC screen.

Yamaha announces the fact that you can recuperate the 3D sound directly in your stream to have a better immersion for your viewers who listen to you with headphones.

I just received it. So unfortunately, I didn't have much time to test it yet but the driver needs to be more stable for the moment.

I plan to use this long weekend to test it (and also test the JVA06 from J5 create which should arrive today \^\^).

i plan to be a variety streamer & be faceless. so i was wondering for video games, what would you, as an audience, want to watch? what interests you guys? also what's the best way to communicate with y'all? discord, twitter? i'm new to being the cc on this side of the screen, the more advice, the merrier:D

as for questions on equipment, i don't plan on going all out on the gaming set up since i'm trying to create a budget. as for the content, i don't usually play games on my laptop except for minecraft, & it's not the type of computer for games, it's used for school & office storage. i play pubg mobile & cod mobile, i'm pretty good @ the battle royale but i kinda wanna learn how to play on a pc. what store would you recommend buying from? what do i need? 
i should be getting the mic soon. i just need a reliable desk to carry two monitors & the actual computer, a gaming mouse. what else should be on my list?

76,Suggestions for Green Screen Setup,1,wkkki4,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/wkkki4/suggestions_for_green_screen_setup/,3,"I've been thinking about getting back into streaming. I've streamed on Twitch for a short while, but due to some poor mental health I never thought I was that engaging or interesting so I sort of stopped. During this time I had perhaps a legitimate beginner setup with a nice web cam and a green screen which barely fit because my mother (who I live with) insisted that we do not remove the bed from the guest room which used to be my old room when my brother was still living with us.

Since then I moved my PC to my new bedroom and have a small desk from IKEA that is right next to my bed. I feel like I lack energy to transfer from room to room (a concern for me really) so it's nice just being able to sit on my bed and conduct my activities right from my bed.

However, thanks to a few friends of mine looking to get back into streaming, I kind of want to do it too. Unfortunately, my new setup has no room for a green screen and lighting (which I also have). I just do not want people to see my unorganized room. Plus who the hell wants to stare at some room unless you have something interesting in it?

**What green screen setup can you recommend me that utilizes my bed/desk setup?**",2022-08-10 08:30:16

I'm a YouTuber who has been making traditional Let's Play content for about 5 years now.  Writing is on the wall that streaming is what most audiences prefer these days, and as much as I want to be an old man yelling at clouds about how let's plays used to be better in every way.. I should probably get with the program.

Twitch seems like the obvious route if I want to stream.  But I'm wondering, if the goal is to drive traffic to my YouTube channel anyways, is it smarter to just stream there, FROM my channel?  

I know that giants like PewDiePie stream on YouTube, but he was huge on the platform before he ever tried streaming.  I know Dr Disrespect and Ludwig are examples of big names who came over from Twitch, but that's obviously because they were offered a ton of money to do so..

For someone like myself who isn't liable to have much (if any) viewership regardless, is it smarter to just stream on YouTube where there's less clutter?  Or is streaming on YouTube garbage?  One thing I've noticed is that YouTube is bad at telling me when my favorite creators are live.  It doesn't seem like a very fleshed out suite of tools. 

I'm rambling so I'll cut it here.  Thanks all for any advice bones you can throw me.  I'm new here but I've been on a bunch of let's play subs for forever now.  This could be an exciting new step!..",2022-08-08 16:31:51

I won't say how much.  He's selling because he has upgraded to a new camera.

Apart from signs of wear, a few general scratches here and there, he promises me it is in full working order, clean sensor, has never let him down, etc.

Now, I know many will say it is overkill for streaming, right?  Well, I am also going to be using it for serious youtube videos (so it's not just my little face in the top corner of the screen).

But the question still stands.  Can I use this for streaming without any issues?

The widest lens I already own is a 24mm (I think 2.8 aperture).  I don't know what mount the lens has, but I guess I can buy a lens adapter if it doesn't fit.

I would like to use autofocus, but I think it might just be a fully manually lens.

Do I need to be worried about recording limits?  I believe this camera has a 30 minute limit.  The reason I ask, is, I'll be streaming, obviously, but I'll also be recording the stream through OBS (which I'll then use for editing purposes).  

Does recording the stream through OBS have any affect on the camera's recording limit, or is that nothing to worry about?

I'll probably be using the Elgato cam link 4k.

And I guess I'll need a dummy battery (that can be powered by USB).

So I have my twitch set as mature content so nobody under 18 should be in there really. I don't do anything lude I just swear alot and make some spicy jokes.

Is there any way to safe guard minors in a discord server???
Some way to turn of the ability for other members to DM/friend them?
Should I have a minors role or is that MORE dangerous?
I really don't want to ban anyone as I wish I'd had more online friends when I was a kid, and the minors don't seem to talk to anyone older but that doesn't mean it'll never happen. idk how to protect them either.

Right now, a member of the group came up with a novel idea, which is to  use one of those all in one security camera solutions, that include the PVR for the video feed and a bunch of cameras, and use Starlink (someone has one) for our internet connection, and somehow get the video feed to a streaming platform (I was thinking via OBS)

Personally I see this as a neat idea but the little experience I've had with those cameras is their a closed ecosystem and likely won't easily mesh with streaming to 3rd party platforms, so any suggestions on setups that's might be more suitable would be appreciated.",2022-08-05 13:05:26

I wanted to do a “Rate My Setup” post to show off what I have been building all these years. I take a lot of pride in the way everything is put together and I am sure some of you can relate when I say that evolving your setup over the years feels like something really special and personal. Below I have pictures of my setup followed by a complete breakdown of what everything is, how some things work, and little tips/oddities that have been added over the years. Let me know what you think!

#The Setup

##[Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/omtZbue)

##Keyboard & Mouse

• **[Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum](https://www.logitechg.com/en-eu/products/gaming-keyboards/g910-orion-spectrum-rgb-gaming-keyboard.html)**: I have to be honest, this keyboard is just total overkill for anything I might need. I don’t really use a lot of the extra bells and whistles that come with it although I do enjoy being able to create macros on the fly when needed. I want to tell you that when I initially purchased this keyboard it wasn’t because of the pretty lights and extra buttons but it probably was because if I had to replace it I wouldn’t replace it with this keyboard. The only noteworthy thing I can tell you about the keyboard is that I have spilled so much crap on it in the past and after a decent cleaning it just goes back to working. Also if you like music rhythm games the wrist rest is nice for keeping the wrists from hurting.

• **[Logitech G600](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.910-002864.html)**: I purchased this mouse years ago after getting into Final Fantasy XIV. I figured the 12 side buttons would help with managing my hot bars and it did an awesome job with that. Weirdly enough though, that isn’t where this mouse has shined most for me. Once I got used to the 12 side buttons I started using it for editing, other games, music production, and more. I thought it might be gimmicky but it has actually been such an awesome improvement to my workflow, whatever that may be at the time. 

##Monitor

• **[Asus MX279H](https://www.asus.com/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/Designo/Designo-MX279H/)**: After using a miserable Viewsonic 31.5” monitor for a long time I wanted something smaller and overall just better quality. After searching around a lot I landed on this monitor which has been nothing but fantastic. It has multiple picture modes (I use either Theater or Standard) so it can look pretty much however you want it to. It doesn’t have a lot of backlight bleeding like my previous monitor so dark areas look actually dark.

##Microphone/Gear

• **[Standard Tripod Microphone Stand](https://www.long-mcquade.com/8769/Furniture---Stands/Stands/Yorkville-Sound/Tripod-Boom-Stand---Black.htm)**: I have tried to get a boom arm for my mic but haven’t had very good results with keeping desk vibrations from affecting my audio when putting things down on my desk. Fortunately I had this microphone stand from a long time ago and since it doesn’t touch the desk I don’t have to worry about those types of issues. It isn’t the prettiest by any means and it definitely takes up more room than I would prefer but it does the job until I can find a good boom arm I can afford. Another benefit to these types of mic stands is that they are relatively affordable, the one I linked to as an example costs twice what I paid for my mic stand.

• **[Maonocaster E2 Podcast Mixer](https://www.maono.com/collections/maonocaster-e2/products/maonocaster-e2-portable-all-in-one-podcast-production-studio?variant=39993115443265)**: This new addition to my setup was actually really exciting for me. As a hobbyist music producer I have always been curious about interfaces and especially XLR microphones. I was never in the position to dive into the XLR world and my Blue Yeti was keeping me satisfied in regards to my audio. Suddenly I was reached out to by the incredible folks at Maono in what I first thought was something too good to be true. Long story short they wanted to see my audio setup upgraded and offered to send me this [wicked mixer](https://imgur.com/a/BRlc9oR) along with a new mic to test it out. For my first sponsorship ever this was such an incredible opportunity I never saw coming and can’t thank Maono enough for everything.

The first thing that really surprised me with the mixer is how light it is. I haven’t tossed it on a scale but I am pretty sure my Stream Deck XL is heavier than it. My initial worry when feeling the weight of it was that it was an indication of cheap build quality but actually the mixer is well put together and the buttons/knobs don’t feel cheaply made when using them. While a lot of my audio levels are usually maintained through OBS itself I have really been loving having more direct control over my voice audio levels. Things like being able to smoothly turn the audio down to make me sound further away while doing a bit adds a lot of flexibility in what I do for fun while streaming.

There are also some interesting extras that I have managed to have fun with. The built in Reverb Presets are a great way to add a little character to some jokes during streams. I also really love being able to loop audio whether from the game or from my microphone. Has really let me have some good laughs with the community. It’s seriously awesome to play with.

• **[PM500 condenser microphone](https://www.maono.com/products/xlr-condenser-microphone-with-34mm-large-diaphragm-maono-au-pm500t)**: To say that this is the most exciting new addition to the setup would be an understatement. After years of looking into them and often going into stores to look **at** them I was finally able to introduce a great sounding [XLR microphone](https://imgur.com/a/EtQc2xb) into my setup. I am someone who has been a long time advocate for Blue’s microphones, especially the Yeti so to be honest I wasn’t sure if I would be switching from it any time soon. Well, I have respectfully been able to retire the Yeti after over a decade of use for this new microphone Maono sent me. Moving from the Yeti to the PM500 was simple since I was already using third-party VSTs inside OBS to clean up my audio but once I began using the microphone it really took things to the next level for me in terms of the clarity, overall sound quality, and fullness of my voice after basic adjustments.

The microphone and mixer came in uniform colored boxes which I know is a weird thing to mention but it made them look like professional gear. They were packaged well and with very little bloat. The microphone came with a shock mount and everything you really need to make your microphone fit it. 

One thing that really surprised me is while the PM500 is smaller than the Yeti that it’s replacing it feels just as heavy. For a little thing it has some real weight which I assume is from the exceptionally sturdy design of it. I can’t see me breaking it anytime soon no matter how energetic I get while streaming and that's good news because I use my gear for a long time before upgrading. The microphone is sensitive but fortunately the mixer’s Denoise feature actually works incredibly well. I was able to remove some of the denoise filters from OBS completely thanks to the new mixer/microphone combo. I was hesitant that the metal pop filter included would be all that useful but it actually does a decent job. I did still order a new foam pop filter for two reasons. I prefer them over screens and since I use fans in the room to keep cool I like to have full coverage around the mic.



• **[Blue Yeti \(Retired\)](https://www.bluemic.com/en-ca/products/yeti/)**: When I first started making content online in 2005 I had one of those miserable cheap vertical standing plastic microphones you could grab for about $20. Then later, once I was more stable I purchased a Blue Snowball microphone and really loved it. Eventually I purchased the Blue Yeti and it was a staple in my setup for a long long time. When it comes to USB mics I don’t think I would ever recommend anything but Blue’s Yeti. It has such a huge place in my heart for sure. It now enjoys it’s days carefully packed away where it shall rest in case its ever needed again.

##Headset & Speakers

• **[Sennheisser PC 363D](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/sennheiser-pc-363d)**: Despite coming out in 2012 this headset has been the best headset I have ever owned. I don’t use any of the extra virtual surround sound settings because the regular audio is so superb. It was definitely expensive at the time and I am not honestly sure if you can even buy them anymore but if you can I am going to find the exact same headset should I ever have to replace it for whatever reason. Though it is worth mentioning that I did snap the microphone off of the headset during a drunk stream incident. Fortunately I wasn’t using it but I do miss it for the VR streams. I am sure in 2022 there are a ton of great headset choices out there but if I had the choice I would use these forever.

• **[Logitech Z623 2.1 Speaker System](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/speakers/z623-speaker-system-thx.980-000402.html)**: I bought these because I am a hobbyist music producer and thought the massive subwoofer would be awesome. Unfortunately whoever designed that subwoofer did so with the intention of **actually** decimating your home and anything in it. I can barely turn the subwoofer up because it will rattle pictures off the walls, shake doors, and probably remove the bolts holding your computer desk together. Fortunately I make this work for me because I use my PC to play guitar and bass using Rocksmith so that heavy bass is awesome when *slappin da bass*. The actual speakers themselves are of great build quality and they sound awesome as a nice bonus. Obviously while streaming I am using my headphones but when rocking out or getting some quick work done they are my go to.

• **[Bose CineMate GS Series 2](https://www.bose.ca/en_ca/support/products/bose_home_theater_support/bose_2_speaker_home_theater_support/cinemate_gs_series2.html)**: Whenever I want to watch a show or a movie this is the sound system I use. My television is my second monitor so I just change the sound output and chill on the couch to watch it. I have had this system for so long that I can’t even remember it not being here. It sounds great and not a single thing has gone wrong with it since I purchased it a long long time ago. Even the controller is still mint lol. The subwoofer is acting as a partial table these days though, sometimes that’s how life goes though I guess.

##Webcam

• **[Logitech C922](https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001087.html)**: The Logitech C920 and C922 have been staples in content creation for a long time. You can definitely find better cameras if you are willing to spend some decent money but if you are on a budget and looking for a good webcam for your content the C922 is a great choice. I used a C920 for years before upgrading to the C922. I am looking to upgrade the camera again but in the meantime I still feel really happy with the quality I get from my camera. It can do either 720p at 60fps (what I use) or 1080p at 30fps. I really like that it has the option to mount on a tripod. I am actually looking at a boom arm for the webcam as well!

##Assist Gear

• **[Stick on hangers for headphones](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/command-timeless-hook-large-brushed-nickel-5-lb-2-3-kg-1-hook-2-strips/1000739808)**: I have a serious space issue in my hobby room so it was becoming a pain managing all of my gear. As I have gotten older I have discovered the joys of the hardware store and its many mysteries. One of my favorite things I have used is various types of stick on wall hangers because they are cheap and work awesome. I have used [this hook](https://imgur.com/a/1KgcQm7) for about 2 years and it has been awesome.

• **[Stick on hangers for headphone cable](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/command-wire-hooks-small-white-0-5-lb-225-g-9-hooks-12-strips-value-pack/1000739822)**: When using my headset I kept having to make sure I wasn’t rolling over the cable with the wheels of my chair. I went back to the hardware store and found [these hooks](https://imgur.com/a/sn65iZY). I stuck it on the wall sideways then used a small and loose zip tie to keep the cable in place. The cable can slide freely through the zip tie and can move with me thanks to the hook. *Please ignore the place below the hook where an older hook was drunkenly torn off the wall accidentally…*

• **[Tool box lining/mat \(can be much cheaper\)](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/tool-box-easyliner--select-grip-18-inch-x-7-ft-black-shelf-liner-6-pack-/1001614948?rrec=true)**: I actually managed to find this at a dollar store but it can be found in a lot of different stores. It doesn’t have to really be a tool box liner but I recommend a thin rubber liner or mat you can put beside your mousepad/keyboard. I stream for a long time each stream so I often have snacks and drinks with me. I found having a liner makes it harder for things to get knocked over, keeps your desk in good condition, makes cleanup really easy, and it looks nice too in my opinion.

• **[DASHER Extended](https://www.ttesports.com/productPage.aspx?p=333&g=ftr)**: This was/is the first really long mouse pad I have ever purchased and I really love it. Having my keyboard and mouse both on the mouse pad looks really good and since I hated sliding the mouse off the mouse pad as a teenager I’m thrilled to never have to worry about it again. About every two months I will take it to the bathtub and use dish soap along with a dish brush to clean it. I scrub it from left to right so I am always ringing it out towards the drain. I rinse it off with mild to hot water and then lay it on a towel. I blowdry it for about 10 minutes then lay another towel on top of it before letting it sit for an hour or so. It has lasted me a long time and looks just like it did when I bought it years ago.

• **[7-Port UGREEN USB Hub 3.0 \(x2\)](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09DCK46PM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**: With all my gear and only 4 rear USB ports on my PC, only 2 of which were 3.0 ports, it was never going to work. I purchased two of these USB hubs for this revamp and it was a great decision. I previously had a single cheap USB hub that often had issues disconnecting devices. Having two allowed me to separate my VR gear from everything else and while that may not sound like much it made a big difference in how I can organize things.

• **[Migeec Cable Management Sleeves](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08M5KB974/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)**: Just wow, this is hands down one of the best things I have bought for my setup. It still looks rough because I have too much going on but as someone who was an avid zip tie user these things are awesome. They are strong and you can even put your own holes in them if you wish. No more cutting zip ties when adding or changing something. Just unzip the cable sleeve, change what you need, then zip it back up. They were pretty cheap and I got 4 in a pack. I will be buying more of these.


• **[Under Cabinet Light](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/commercial-electric-touch-light-6-inch-led-white-under-cabinet-strip-light/1001523705)**: I could never see anything when going under my desk to do something and I would usually end up propping my phone up somewhere so I could see what I was doing. I bought [one of these](https://imgur.com/a/kW5tiv7) under cabinet lights for less than $20 and it is such a nice quality of life improvement. It is bright and has a 15 minute timer so if you turn it on you can do what you need to and forget about it, it will turn off. It can be screwed in or you can use an adhesive strip like I did. I just stuck it to the underside of my desk near the back of the desk. So great to have it.

• **[Elgato Collapsible Green Screen](https://www.elgato.com/en/green-screen)**: I had a huge issue finding a green screen to use in such a small space and the ones I could find made me feel like I was being punished when trying to fold them back up. I finally decided to spend some money and purchased Elgato’s green screen. The clips for it are really low quality but I can’t deny that it has made having a convenient green screen setup possible for me. It is really easy to store and while the clips that keep it closed suck the casing itself is pretty great. The green screen is also very durable. I drunkenly fell into it, knocking it over, and it didn’t have a mark or crinkle. *I’m working on the drinking*.

##Lighting Setup & Bulbs

• **[LIFX Color E26 \(x 3\)](https://www.lifx.com/products/lifx-color-800-e26-1pk)**: Like I mentioned before I don’t have a lot of room in my hobby room. I also don’t have a ton of money so I can’t get a ton of studio stuff that fits the space. My solution was to invest in smart lights but like I said I don’t have a ton of money and couldn’t afford anything that needed a base station or something similar. I found this brand of light that works pretty dang well while also being relatively affordable. It doesn’t require a base station and instead just works through an app. I bought these in the hopes that I could bypass needing diffusers, it sort of works. I can definitely light the green screen properly but I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel slightly blinded after a few hours sometimes. A surprise benefit of using smart lights is that my Stream Deck can actually control them making quick lighting switches during a stream a literal button press.

##In Depth Stream Deck Showing

• **[Stream Deck XL](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-xl)**: This is something that I recommend everyone get, even if you don’t create content but spend a lot of time on your PC. I initially purchased a small version of the Stream Deck and after spending a week with it I promptly returned it so I could order the XL version. The Stream Deck community is incredible and with all the plugins available you can do nearly anything it feels like. I control so many things from the Stream Deck that it genuinely feels like a piece of next gen equipment. I could tell people about it forever because I have had so much fun with it. I have nearly all of my launchers available at a glance, I can change the game audio levels to preset levels without alt tabbing, create clips instantly so I can export elsewhere, do in game camera zooms for jokes, activate emotes/sound effects/animations/videos, shout out raiders or friends, and so so much more. 

[This is what I am typically looking at while streaming](https://imgur.com/a/18FF6tH), it is such a great setup. One of my favorite things is if something happens that I don’t want to clip for whatever reason I can create a marker I will see when making the VOD. I also want to stress one more time how nice it is for me to be able to control the light presets in my room without touching my phone. I have to end my Stream Deck rant here because I seriously won’t stop. It is a fantastic piece of gear that really only reveals its potential after you’ve spent time with it yourself.

##Bonus Widgets/Tools

• **[TriggerFyre](https://overlays.thefyrewire.com/widgets/triggerfyre/)**: I use this so my chat can activate videos and GIFs on my stream. It has a lot of customization options but really it is just a fun tool to give your chat access to. I made 50 commands for my chat but then only told them that 50 commands existed. They have had a lot of fun trying to figure out what commands will pull up a video or gif.


• **[Sound Alerts](https://soundalerts.com/)**: This will allow your chat to activate sound clips of your choosing. I have had a lot of funny moments pop up on stream because of this widget but it obviously needs some policing. My community is small and awesome so I haven’t had a reason to police it much but just a heads up to those with larger communities and viewership. 


• **[Stream Ladder](https://streamladder.com/)**: If you are an avid clipper like I am then this is the quickest and easiest way to share your moments on TikTok. Now I don’t really like TikTok but there is no denying that for getting your name out there it can be a great resource. This makes putting your clips on TikTok easy and fast so you are in and out without any hassle. I have had some decent engagement from sharing clips and it is worth mentioning that using Stream Ladder also makes your clips the perfect format for YouTube shorts.

• **[Stream Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BR3LR5y7Eb3v3KcBGvVzHdLA-8cDQHStDdmE-syA4w/edit?usp=sharing)**: This is a guide I have been updating for a few years every now and then. If you are interested in starting to stream or just want to learn more about the software you are using as well as other topics then this is for you. This has been a fun pet project for me since I started it and my only aim is to help others get into making content online. 

---

Lastly I just really want to thank [Maono](https://www.maono.com/) for enabling me to do this. I am not a very popular person, more of a quality over quantity guy, so this was awesome. When they first reached out to me I thought it was a scam but nope, they were kind and professional, only asking for a shipping address. I got the gear and was surprised at the quality of it so I bought a bunch of small things to really take it to the next level. I just wanted to thank them for everything, it is really cool to experiment with some XLR gear. I couldn’t have afforded it otherwise. Cheers!",2022-08-05 08:30:05

I got indefinitely banned from twitch 1 month ago, I am not allowed to get into the details of it or say that I do or do not deserve but here are very vague facts that I think will help readers get a better grasp of my situation:

- I was not being racist homophobic or anything else of that nature
- this was my first offence
- I was banned because I typed something that I should not have typed in someone else’s chat

I put in a ban appeal the day I got banned (July 5 2022) and haven’t heard back. I’ve never heard of anyone getting unbanned on twitch, unless they were banned by accident, mass report or because of a bug. Is it even possible to be unbanned if you actually broke T.O.S?

For me here in the UK, the price difference is £100 vs £135, so, I could get either one really.  I was at first going to get the Podmic as it is smaller, but strangely enough, it is actually heavier, and as it will be on a boom arm, I figure I want it to me as light as possible.

As it is an XLR mic, I will need an interface, so I am going to get a Scarlett Solo.  No idea how it works yet, but I'll figure it out.

Do most people here use XLR or is USB good enough.  As I will be doing more than streaming, youtube videos, etc, I thought maybe I should invest in an XLR mic.

But would love to hear people's thoughts.

Also, separate question, everyone says invest in good lighting but almost never explain what good lighting is.

Right now, I am thinking a light with a softbox.  A big concern for me is pointing a light straight at my face and possibly inducing headaches.  At least a softbox will help lessen that.  I might even point it as a wall (I recently painted the room white).

However, space is limited and so I might have trouble putting it on the floor.  Instead, I was thinking maybe these small led lights might work, as I'll clip them to the desk, but I don't know about the quality of their light output (or if they'll induce a headache in me).

Any info is appreciate.

What about a ring light?  Would that be a better way to go?",2022-08-04 01:49:23

If I am making youtube content, I am going to need a semi-decent camera, so I might as well just out right buy a new one.  I'll buy some semi-decent lighting too.  Maybe a cheap softbox and such.  I don't yet but I'll figure it out.

I had been messing with almost every setting trying to get my stream to stabilize, and switched to ethernet, still the results were not improving. I experienced loss in frame rate at exponential rates. I was starting to think it was a lost cause. And that for some reason my internet just wasn't good enough.
I realized that my internet wasn't the problem because even though my stream frame rate was dropping, I wasn't getting dropped frames notification, and that tells me it's a hardware problem.
I started up a stream and opened every hardware monitoring software I have on my pc. 

Lo and behold I discovered the problem. While streaming using nvenc new encoder, my RTX 3080 would be at 98, 99, and 100 percent. As soon as I saw the 100 percent I stopped the stream.
I changed my encoding to my 12700k and instantly saw stable frames while sitting at 70 percent utilization and about 60 degrees. 

I never thought to change my encoding because well, I have a 3080, it should be no problem right? I didn't want to switch the encoding to my cpu because of apparent false information everywhere.

I've been debating trying my hand at streaming for some eventual side income. I'm curious as to whether you think it'd be more worth it to start out on YouTube or Twitch.

I believe I heard that Twitch nets you more money per viewer than other websites, and I know that YouTube is comparatively ""new"" to the streaming side of things, and arguably still working out some of the kinks based (supposedly, I would hope so) on the feedback from the big streamers they've been bringing over there.

However, I have a certain gaming username that I've used ever since I originally took up gaming. It has sentimental value to me, so I'm not interested in ""re-branding"" (not that I have a brand image yet, but all of my accounts are currently named accordingly). On YouTube, I've secured this usename. On Twitch, it is taken by an inactive account. It's not an account that you can find via regular searching (at least, I couldn't), but if you know the username, and therefore the URL, you can find the profile. Unfortunately, I went searching and viewed the channel this way before I read about Twitch's username recycling policies and the fact that my viewing of that channel probably just hurt the chances of it being recycled anytime soon. 

So, username-wise, I feel like I'd like to just go with YouTube; but I also don't know which is the better choice financially (before you get many views) and which is the better choice in terms of being discovered.

I'm looking to get into streaming. I spend a lot of time gaming and used to hos radio shows. I figure those things go hand in hand a bit. 

Not to phased on ""getting big and making it my job"" sorta thing. I just like doing things right.

Basically I need a microphone and some sort of mixer. 

However, I also make a bit of music on the side (mostly synth   sequencer mpc jams) and would really like to get a mixer that I can use for that as well. 

My gear consists of 3 items. I feel like it would be good to be able to run them all off their own channel. 
I only need one mic I input. A headphone out and a trs or balanced output for my studio speakers.

I feel like I could just grab some Yamaha mix desk thing but then I would probably lose out on some of the streaming PC features. 
I would obviously like to be able to run voice and game sound into the stream and game chat separately. This is where I get a bit confused on my search.

There's so many varying options that my brain kind of seizes up and I lose focus.

As this is just hobby stuff, I would prefer to not be spending too much. 

Any help weeding out the good things to look at would he amazing! Is this style of set up even possible or am I going to need a separate soundcard and mixer. I like the idea of the rode podcaster thing but it's way to expensive. but an all in one would probably be cheaper than getting two separate bits so if I have to spend a bit more to achieve my goals then that's ok. 

Ps: I do have headphones already. And I do like sliders and kill switches.

So being trans comes with a whole heap of issues. I'm not going to say I hate my voice, but my voice comes off masculine. It is as simple as that. I want to sound natural and trying to force a voice (with no voice training) is almost unbearable. Plus I would easily slip up when I get frustrated (yeah it might be funny to watch me rant away as I know I do once I die in a game) and lose focus trying to perfect my voice and game. I have no idea what to do and I know these voice changers make claims and fail to deliver or sound genuine without being robotic, plus I won't have a decent mic so that won't help. Should I go natural and just let myself be misgendered, or do I mention being trans a ton?

250,Some general questions about streaming?,2,w4uixq,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/w4uixq/some_general_questions_about_streaming/,10,"So, I have to be honest, I don't fully know all the ins and outs of streaming, or even why people do it (and audiences watch it), but it's something I want to do.

I mean, firstly, why do people actively watch other people play videogames?  That seems like a strange thing to me.  Before streaming became a thing, if someone told you that other people will simply watch gamers play videogames, I don't think many of us would think it would be a thing that caught on and became so massive.  But it clearly has.  I just don't understand why it has.  It still seems kinda weird to me (but at the same time, really interesting).

Anyway, it is something I'd like to do.  Now, I should say, I am not someone who wants to play competitive warzone type stuff, killing other players and running all over the place at insane speeds (I do actually play it, I am just not ""good"" at it).

Instead, I am more interested in playing longform games (just solo, no teammate type thing).  Like mystery games or scary haunted house type horror games.  There is a guy on youtube called ""Hollow"" who tends to play the type of stuff I'd like, but I don't know if this is an accepted or popular type of thing on Twitch?  Is it?  Can you literally stream anything you want?

Also, I would like to simultaneously have a youtube channel too.  But again, I don't really know how youtube would work in parallel to Twitch.

What I mean is, can I use the streams I have on twitch and also upload them as videos to youtube?  Or do you have to have entirely different content on both sites?  

I am also asking this particularly in reference to any kind of sponsorship or financing you are making (which is not something I expect to actually make at first, maybe not even for a long time).

To be honest, again, I don't even know how you get paid and make money exactly on twitch or youtube.

I got a Inateck VD1001 capture card for 40 bucks and reviews appeared to be okay. To my surprise Im having trouble getting it working. 

I have connected the cables as the manual says and as you should with pretty much any similar   
capture card. USB 3.0 on the PC. The Xbox's HDMI port I used the HDMI that was given with the capture card and connected to HDMI IN of the capture card. And HDMI OUT goes to my monitor.

I get passthrough but no signal on OBS. The PC detects the USB 3.0 device, drivers are updated, tried disabling and enabling on device manager, changing positions of HDMIs, checked PC's and Xbox's privacy settings, switched to energy saver mode on the Xbox (i read its the equivalent of turning off HDCP on the PS5), etc

I make a post here in case if anyone has heard about or had this capture card. Maybe it just sucks.

Or if I should try anything or If I did something wrong.

In order to do this I'm looking into some kind of API access to streaming software or any kind of way to interact programmatically, e.g. websocket support.

I've come across this FFdynamic software:

[https://github.com/Xingtao/FFdynamic](https://github.com/Xingtao/FFdynamic)

However, despite that I could successfully run the Docker image, I couldn't produce a working RTMP stream.

I checked out OBS Studio with [https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket)

used with [https://github.com/IRLToolkit/simpleobsws/tree/master](https://github.com/IRLToolkit/simpleobsws/tree/master)  Python library.

However I couldn't run the dvd sample properly. Plus, even if I could run, it would not do dynamic composition.

I probably want to simulate video composition happening with video conference software but only for streaming that as a single output video.

I personally spent months messing with my capture card (Mirabox HSV325) trying to get it to work. I read everything I could find online, bought a USB4 40Gbps cable to confirm it wasn't a bandwidth issue, and reached out to Mirabox support for information from which I got no reply.

The card I have is the Mirabox HSV325 (The one that looks like a oversized keychain accessory). Online it is rated pretty well and the specs it claims are good. It's affordable at \~$90 and it can do 4K resolution at 30fps, or 1080p at 60fps which is among the best you could find for the price.

Unfortunately my experience with the device has been that it immediately loses the video feed after 3 seconds of operation, then goes into a loop of where the video runs, then dies every 3 seconds.

So what's causing the issue you might ask? It turns out it's an unreliable VBus design. Basically the power coming from the USB-C cable dips when the Video output starts, and that power drop is enough to cause the board to lose the input signal for just a moment. So what's the solution? More power!

You might be able to get a USB-C cable that allows you to feed power from a secondary source. I haven't tried that and to me that seems a little dangerous. I'd hate for a setup like that to burn out the USB port on the device or worse your PC.

My solution is to use the test traces on the board to add a port for a 5V 2A DC Power Supply. On the board inside there is a 4 pin test port with 4 through holes in a row. The outside pins are -V (for trace 1 with the silver square) and V+ (for trace 4). By giving power to those pins you can power up the board without a USB cable. This should be safe to do since the board appears to be designed to handle power over either port.

I've tested running the board using a DC Power supply and the USB port and had it working without any issue. All that needs to be done is to solder wires to add a port for a DC barrel jack. Then just plug in a 5V 2A DC Supply along with the other cables used for the device.

Even though I consider this mod to be totally safe since it's utilizing a port that was designed by the OEM. if you chose to mod your board do so at your own risk! It will certainly void the warranty but to me it's better than having dead hardware.

Hopefully this helps anyone who has ran into this same issue and couldn't find a solution.Good vibes and Happy streaming friends.

The games I’m planning on playing is Horror, Survival, open world, RPGs, FPSs, and as well as Asymmetrical multiplayer games on PC and PS4 as well. I’m also planning to stream twice a week for maybe like 2-3 hours a day. Obviously if I get more and more popular I’d stream more and more. But I hear 2 days is good enough starting.",2022-07-18 19:42:10

The games look good on my gaming pc, but in OBS on the streaming pc the games come through very choppy.

YouTube, twitch, etc. videos look good when projecting full screen from the gaming pc to OBS on the streaming pc. It seems only games have the choppy issue. And capping my frames in-game at 60fps fixes the issue.

I had this setup working just fine a few months ago where I didn’t need to cap my frames at 60.  Since then I have moved both pcs around the house but haven’t changed any settings, I don’t think.

Each time I get “no signal” or “capture card is not connected” style warnings in the elgato 4k capture utility (idk why it’s this one now, I still have the older capture software version on my main pc but this newer is what showed up when I went to install for HD60s drivers on the laptop earlier).

The cons I had on the Kiyo Pro was that it had a fish eye problem on wide FOV, and of course the software.
The thing I did like about the Kiyo was the color and that it could turn vertically and horizontally, while the Brio 4k can't turn horizontally, which is an awful design, but it doesn't matter because I got a stand for it.  

I guess the main loss was that I paid an extra $40, just to avoid synapse.

Currently I am working as student intern for a music university where I am in charge of helping to organise a music competition.

The overlay should be present on the screen for about 10 seconds and then disappear until the group will perform the next piece. Once they move on to perform the next piece, an overlay should appear again, this time with the new information. What would be the easiest/fastest way to do something like that in Streamlabs obs for example?

From what I've read 16GB ram is enough to stream on. The i3 CPU is what I'm guessing is slowing things down the most. Not sure how the graphics card measures up. Pretty sure these are the priorities but let me know if the motherboard/SSD is more important than I think.

343,Advice on a custom setup!,1,vxp38q,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/vxp38q/advice_on_a_custom_setup/,2,"
Hi there,

I have 3 monitors (Samsung tv, dell curved widescreen 4K, dell 1080p). 

And I have 4 sources (pc, mac, Xbox X, ps5) 

I’m trying to figure out how I can get a setup where my computers will extend display across all 3 monitors, with shared keyboard/mouse/webcam/speakers/mic/music production, but my Xbox or PS5 can take over one or more of the monitors, thereby adjusting the display extension down to 2 or 1 for the computer, instead  of 3. 

I’m not totally sure how to do this. HDMI matrix’s don’t allow for screen extension, just mirroring, while it seems KVMs have to take over all the screens at once rather that splitting signal. 

I’m thinking maybe I do a [4x2 HDMI matrix](https://www.amazon.com/FERRISA-Switcher-Splitter-Optical-Extractor/dp/B07MYRX22F/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=2CDASFPL0ZNVH&keywords=4x2+hdmi+matrix&qid=1657669047&sprefix=4x2+hdmi+%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-3)and the first output is the TV, while the second output is the [Plugable Dock,](https://plugable.com/products/ud-6950) which extends display on both dell monitors with DisplayPort. This would at least allow me to swap matrix input to to put a computer on the monitors and game console on tv (or vice versa), while still supporting some sort of display extension mode for the laptop. 

Then I could do a simple [usb kvm switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B09BTSH2HW/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_7?smid=A1TSGWVKUSYJV1&psc=1) plus [usb hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07G8CMR18?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_image) to share all devices 

Would this work? I don’t know if HDMI matrices upstream of that plugable Dock will work or not. 

If you have any suggestions or experience with setups like this, I would love to hear it!

I'm a small YouTuber. I just really started streaming more regularly this past week, and I had two guys jump in my chat Thursday that were just way overly friendly off the rip. One was there for about an hour so alone, and then the second came in and just so happened to know the other. (""Oh hey man, what are you doing here?"" kind of deal) Gave me a good boost of confidence the first night actually having people to chat with, and one of them even offered to help me tidy up my Discord server (open for suggestions, but I'm happy with it and not comfortable giving anyone I just met mod privileges). Friday night they bombarded me with viewers by sharing my stream with friends and in various Discord servers, at least that's what I was told by them.

What's making me uncomfortable is:

1) They all started asking for my CashApp, saying they wanted to send me money. Wasn't comfortable with that, so I directed them to my StreamElements tipping page. They weren't interested anymore.

2) The guy didn't make suggestions to fix my server.... He sent me a link to a whole new server after Friday's stream saying my new server was almost done. Didn't ask me or say anything about it beforehand. Only been ""acquainted"" for 24 hours.

3) None of them have interacted with me since Friday, especially after I didn't show interest in the new server they made for me or give them my CashApp. They invited 8 other people to my Discord that were fairly active Friday night while I was live but have been radio silence since as well.

It's all made me a little weirded out about going live and having them in my chat again. Since then, I've double checked all my server roles and made sure everything was locked down for anyone except mods, and after noticing half of them didn't even accept my rules and get a role in the server I've made sure they can't see anything except my welcome category. If you can't read and click a button for me, I don't want you chatting in my server.

Am I being a little crazy or do people just do these things out of the blue?",2022-07-11 13:13:03

I run a i7 10700K/RTX 3080 build for my main PC. I also run a triple screen racing rig. 

I am currently using all 4 ports on my 3080 with the three 2k 165hz triples, then my main 4k 160hz gaming monitor. 

I am looking to buy a 3600x pc for very cheap($200), and throw my extra 1650 Super in it. 

The reason for the second PC is that my 3080 is maxed out at 95-100% during gaming with the above setup, so using NVENC on it causes a very sluggish feeling, as it does not have the extra 10-15% GPU headroom to run. Though X264 on fast feels fine, it still takes about 20% of my frames in CPU intensive games.

Are you able to use the HDMI from the 1650 Super that would go to a HDMI to USB 3.0/C adapter into the main PC, or do you need to plug GPU to GPU? 

If not, would NDI be a better option? Looks easy enough to setup.

And no I am not streaming in 4K. Currently 720p/60fps with 4500 bitrate. Looking to future proof it for a 1080p/60fps 6000 bitrate when I get the source options.",2022-07-10 06:14:29

For the past few days I've been having so many issues that I want to throw the entire computer away. First it started with OBS putting all audio on every track available. Fixed that. Then I hopped into Discord voice chat and was told I sounded so different that my friends couldn't recognize my voice and that my mic was so loud it almost blew out their speakers. My Discord settings had not changed but I turned down the volumes any way.

&#x200B;

So, I've been working on my mic since then and nothing is fixing my problems. Every available background noise gets picked up. My typing, mouse clicks, even if someone closes a door somewhere else in the house my mic picks it up. It is also picking up sound from my headset.

I tried editing settings in Logitech G Hub but most of the time it won't allow me to record a sample so I have no idea if it's working. I checked the levels on Windows.

Looking for a platform to live-stream an on-stage fashion show event through an inexpensive (less than $150) platform.

We are looking to monetize the stream (charge to watch), so Zoom Events seemed like a good option. Streaming via our Wix website also seemed like an option - but I haven't been able to find anything about quality/stability with Wix.

423,Can you stream TOO much?,5,vrbeya,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/vrbeya/can_you_stream_too_much/,16," 

I  started streaming last year and I found myself enjoying streaming a  lot. Like... A LOT. I literally stream everyday for 6-8hours, sometimes  12h. Two weeks ago I completed second 24h charity stream. In last 4  months I didn't stream in like 4 days.

My channel grows everyday and I'm very satisfied with the direction  of my twitch channel and the comunity I grew through this year.

I started with literally 0 viewers and last night my stream had 72  avarage viewers with monthly summary 55. This month I didn't skip a  single day streaming (I streamed 30 days in last 30 days.) Sometimes I got rided by bots, but I always remove them with twitch  followers remover after stream, so I know for a fact my followers number  is genuine (it's around 2.2k right now)

Lately I was thinking about my followers and my community. I have  like 20-30 very faithful viewers that always come back, but there are  some very strong viewers that come to see me every day and stay for like  hours, but then they dissapear after a month or so. I had dozens of  people like that. And I know it's propably normal, but still, I was  thinking, maybe I'm streaming TOO much? Is it a problem?

My logic with this problem is that - If people watch me every single  day, for like... hours, they will sooner or later get bored of me, my  personality, the game I play (I focus on my channel on ONE game 5 days  per week and 2 days per week with ""variety""). So I was thinking, from  the... hm, let's say economic point of view (and maybe mental health of  my viewers lol) would be better to stream less, and limit my exposure to  4-5 days per week, or make shorter stream, so I could make my viewers  more exited when im actually online, instead being someone for them  that's it's always there, each stream this way would be a bit more  special?

455,Some questions about anonymity when streaming,3,vnirfp,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/vnirfp/some_questions_about_anonymity_when_streaming/,1,"Sorry in advance for the long post, TL;DR at the bottom.  


I'm interested in streaming, likely under a VTuber alias. I intend for it to be an extension of things I already do, like games I play or lengthy chats with friends. 

  
Safety is a concern, though, if I decide to ever pursue things further (which I'd like to set myself up for), and I'm curious if anyone has any recs as to handle some tougher parts of anonymity when streaming games.  


\-How do you handle games in which progress is tied to the account, but the account has some sort of permanent recognizable mark? (Username history, permanent user ID, etc.).  
  I obviously don't want to just abandon all of my old progress for games like Overwatch, or Minecraft servers in which progress is tied to the account, but maintaining 2 separate accounts almost sounds worse.  


\-How do you handle playing with friends?  
  If I intend on ever streaming with people that I already talk to that *don't* have their own alias, and could be tracked back to me, how do I handle that? Am I meant to just separate them?  


\-How do you handle existing online presence?  
  Things like any sort of volunteer work (project teams, moderation, etc.), or just large presence in fandoms. Do you rebrand somehow? Swallow the pill and get rid of your old presence? Maintain two separate accounts?  


  
I'm super open to chat personally with someone if they're willing to provide answers, otherwise, I appreciate any and all advice!  


**TL;DR:**  
How do you handle existing game progress, friends, and online presence?",2022-06-29 22:41:34

I’ve seen this question asked multiple times already so I preemptively apologize for the double post. But as I searched most questions related to a dual PC setup and not an all in one. So was hoping to get some clarification in the differences that may be involved with a single PC over a dual setup. 

My main PC has pretty decent hardware (I’ll list below) but I was wondering how to optimally configure it to get the most out of this PC and maybe eventually move to a dual Pc setup if streaming/content creation begins to sustain itself outside of being a hobby.

Besides the hardware listed, is there anything else I should add hardware wise to assist in being an all-in-one?  As well as any software that may help assist in streaming quality. I’m aware of OBS and it’s derivates but I’m more referring to any kind of educational articles, videos or first hand knowledge on configuring that software to get the most out of an all-in-one setup

Hardware:
Mobo - Asus Strix X570-i 
CPU - AMD Ryzen 9 5950x
GPU - Nvidia RTX 3090 FE
Ram - Corsair Vengeance 32gb x2 (64gb total)
Capture Card - Elgato 4k60

**Edit**: I should have also stated that internet is not an issue as I have access to gigabit internet. Whoops

Goal:
*reliable* 720p 60fps streaming

With the 3090 being such a chungus I’ll more than likely have to upgrade to a larger mobo to get it the capture card to fit, or use a pcie extension cable.  Unless I want to forgo using the capture card entirely.",2022-06-30 14:12:10

The scenario:

* We have a Panasonic GH3 mirrorless camera hooked up to her laptop via camlink; it's currently mounted in vertical orientation
* We are trying to experiment with more vertical content, particularly for YouTube and Instagram livestreams
* She ideally wants to be able to invite viewers onto the stream \[one at a time\] to answer their questions, etc. and then move on to the next

I've been wanting to stream but I've come to the conclusion that my system can't handle a 1080p60 stream (even at the lowest settings; games tried: RE2 Remake)

Currently, I have an R5 2600 and an RX 570 in my tower atm. I am currently looking to upgrade my rig and I was wondering if I need to upgrade my CPU. I'm for sure going to upgrade my GPU but I'm unsure if I should get the 3070ti or 3080 to have my stream looking decent and the game still looking good at a decent frame rate for the stream not to look choppy.

My studio monitors have the option to connect through both XLR and USB. I was looking at getting the Focusrite Scarlett but I'm not sure my studio monitors can connect to it and I'm not sure what can.

2.When testing if audio is working I use YouTube since i use a mixer and it's easier for me. While in YouTube all the video thumbnails were tearing and distorting on the SLOBS preview, but not my main screen. I haven't been able to figure this one out.

Just joined this group. So I am fairly new in live streaming and I am barely getting all my setup finalized, just debating so hard on whether or not I can get away with the laptop that I have right now to actually start live streaming or if that's even the problem.

Please do correct me if I am in the wrong subreddit for this. But I figured, considering the number of streamers here, you guys would know more if this will even be worth pushing through.

My idea and what I have so far:I play mainly from PS4, I don't have a gaming PC suitable for the games that I like playing. I want to live stream my gameplay on Twitch/YouTube and I already have OBS installed on my laptop. I have tried remote play at first, but the video quality was horrible - but then again, when I tried it the first time, I relied on Wi-Fi on both laptop and PS4. But I purchased a cheap game capture card, and after that, was able to connect both PS4 and laptop using ethernet connection and never tried the remote play again.IT WORKED, video quality was better - HOWEVER, the lag was so noticeable, and I wasn't sure if it was an Internet connection, a game capture card issue, a laptop issue, or just basically everything. I have looked it  up on what might be the actual issue, but all sites are just giving you the general information on what you need and what you have to do.

My setup (so far):- ethernet connection both laptop and PS4- PS4 connected to my laptop usb using cheap game capture card- cheap Microsoft webcam to my laptop using usb- laptop has OBS, have all sources setup

I guess I just need suggestions on what I can possibly change one at a time (aside from everything) to make it better.

Anything will be appreciated.

527,How I managed to to hit 6 avg. viewers in less than 24 hours of streaming and what YOU CAN DO to achieve the same,9,veo3t0,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/veo3t0/how_i_managed_to_to_hit_6_avg_viewers_in_less/,3," Yesterday I hit **23 hours of ""on air time""** according to my channel stats page. In that short span of time **more than 400 unique viewers** took a look at what I was doing and **on average 5,5-6 viewers** stuck around and participated in the fun.

What did I do?

As an IT-strategy and management consultant I have a fairly analytical way of approaching new challenges. So here is what I did:

1. Set the **purpose of my streams**: For me it was using my few hours of gaming that I can get after work and kids went to bed more productively / with more purpose.
2. Set **my goal**: I wanted to see how quickly I can manage to get to affiliate without really setting myself a time limit. If your goal is to have fun in your favorite game that is totally fine. However I believe that it will be difficult to fast track your progress in overcrowded or unpopular games.
3. Invest mildly into a better **quality mic** so that viewers might actually stay and listen / watch
4. **Game choice**: This one is **the single most critical thing** you need to do in my opinion: I did a lot of research and a bit of introspection in order to come up with 2-3 games that I would actually have fun streaming and would help me grow  

   1. Look at the games in ""browse"" and write down every game that you would want to stream that **averages between 500 and 2000 viewers**. Do this several times a day to make sure you get a feeling for certain trends.
   2. Look at these games and see if any of them have **20 or less streamers** with the ideal scenario of **max 5 streamers with 0-1 viewer**.
   3. Look for games that are streamed by a **variety of different languages**. That helps if you want to stream in English but still stick out somewhat.
   4. Make sure you understand when the average **viewer count drops** typically within a day.
5. Okay, now that you have your game **stream roughly an hour before the drop** in viewers start to hit and make sure you have your camera turned on.
6. What also helps is a **well crafted title** that tells viewers something about you or the unique perspective you have on the game you are streaming. For me it was that I was a returning Beta-Player checking out the game for the first time in years.
7. whatever you do and no matter how many viewers you have: **KEEP ON TALKING!** even 15 seconds of silence is too long if you want to grow your average viewers

I found Gwent and at certain times of the day HotS to be perfect fits for me. And since I am not crowded out by many streams, I have an engaging title with a unique concept for the stream/game the hosts and raids did come in and they will for you. People like to support small streamers at the end of their stream, especially in smaller communities.

**Within 10 hours of streaming I had a massive 120 viewer raid and several since.** Obviously raids and hosts are not the ultimate solution since most people don't stay long, but some do... and you only need an average of 3!

As a smaller streamer who doesn’t make that much off of twitch (~$100) a month, I was debating donating 50% of all donations towards those “milestones” to charity. I want to make it worth my time and effort, as a 24 hour stream and all the planning is a lot of work, but I also don’t want to come across as a scum bag. Is this okay? Should I just do 100%?

**EDIT thank you guys for the feedback! I think my plan is going to be to:**

- have a link where people can donate directly to charity and have 100% of it go there, and have milestone challenges for my community. 

- have the same thing set up for gifted subs and bits, with challenges for every X amount of bits or subs gifted, but this will be for me personally.

I’m not very knowledgeable on this.

Should I use my gpu to record and stream or a mixture of both?

High quality recordings to upload at 1440p
Decent stream at 720p
High FPS as I play only Warzone.

544,Advice on using text-to-speech instead of a mic?,3,vcr9ch,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/vcr9ch/advice_on_using_texttospeech_instead_of_a_mic/,9,"I've been wanting to start up streaming for a while (more likely doing art than gaming) but I'm mute, so I can't speak on stream. Since I don't exactly have the gaming skills to attract any audience as a no-mic no-commentary streamer, I've been thinking about using text-to-speech instead, like Zentraya from VShojo. As far as I'm aware, she uses some kind of speech-to-text-to-speech setup (dictating what she's saying out loud to a program that reads the dictated text back or some shit like that), which I can't copy outright because, like I said, talking is an issue for me. 

I've been experimenting with Notepad and Windows Narrator, which hypothetically could work because it can read as I'm typing, but since Narrator is a screen reader, it has the side effect of reading out any and all text on screen and can be a bit finicky trying to get the damn thing to shut up--which I don't entirely mind myself, but I worry that might be a turn-off to some viewers that might otherwise be receptive to a more easily-wrangled TTS. Other than Narrator, though, I've been struggling to find a free text-to-speech program that reads the text immediately after hitting the enter key, because most of the ones out there inconveniently and annoyingly make you move the cursor to click a ""read text"" button on the opposite end of the screen, then move the cursor back to the text box to type something else. Clownfish is too buggy for my liking; when I tested it, it flat-out would not play any audio. Can anyone recommend any other programs, or do you think Windows Fucking Narrator would work fine?

And if there's nothing available on browsers or Windows, I have a decent-enough AAC app on my iPad that I usually use in my daily life that I wouldn't mind also using for streaming, but if I just played it straight out the tablet's speakers, I don't think my mic is good enough to pick up the sound clearly; it'd be kind of like the audio equivalent of pointing a camera at your TV screen instead of using a capture card to record game footage. If possible, does anyone know of a way to get the audio from my iPad to play as audio output on my computer?",2022-06-15 17:18:30

My considerations seem to mostly fit with streamer needs, even though I don't stream. Instead, I record course videos where I show myself on a webcam and my screen (where I am presenting or drawing stuff). I might do webinars in the future (which is basically streaming), but have no concrete plans yet.

For now, I have a very simple set-up: A (way too old 720p) webcam that also captures my audio. I have been using a very simple setup through Loom. But I am ready to up my game and make my courses more interesting through OBS scenes.

I need suggestions for video, but most importantly for audio because there are too many relevant options!

**Video**

I have been thinking of getting a Logitech C920S, Elgato Facecam, or using Elgato EpocCam on my phone. My phone's camera isn't the best (Poco F3), but might do the trick! Any thoughts?

**Audio**

Besides recording course videos, I also want to use this microphone on a PC and a Mac for video calls (using a KVM switch), as well as for gaming on the PC. Decent noise cancellation is important for the latter, as I will be doing that in our living room.

I have been wracking my brain. I am stuck between:

- Beacn Mic

A USB mic with excellent software that offers easy-to-use noise canceling. Doesn't officially support Mac (yet), but I read the profiles are saved on the mic so it is still usable on Macs without the software.

- Elgato XLR + Rode PodMic

Elgato also seems to have good audio software, and I can use VSTs to set up noise cancellation. I don't have the money for a SM7B right now, but using an XLR interface does provide that option down the line. Also works nicely with Macs.

- Shure MV7
Works nicely with Macs. Software is lacking.

It looks like it could be 3x bigger than current social media commerce if it does.

Live streaming sites like Twitch, Facebook etc could be at the center of it. They have the audience, the engagement and the Creators. Big question is whether brands and audiences can get behind it.

&#x200B;

I've been slowly trying to problem-solve this for days. I got a used HD60 S+ off Amazon last week and was excited to use it to connect and stream my PS3.

&#x200B;

I have an older Microsoft Surface Pro **4** that I first hooked it up to. It has only one USB port, but it's USB 3.0 (shows in Device Manager) as required by the device (via the message that the 4K Capture Utility software gives me, written in the topic). I also have a small USB hub for this device which allows me to connect it to my wired network, all of the (3) ports on which are ALSO USB 3.0. Plugging the device in to any of these ports does not work.

&#x200B;

I also have a \~4-year-old Dell ""gaming"" laptop (I don't know the model offhand) which has 3 USB 3.0 ports on it. None of these ports seem to work, either, and give me the same message as I receive on the Surface. For good measure, I used the little hub (mentioned before) with this laptop and I get the same results.

&#x200B;

Searching online, I found that some people had success installing Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible drivers. I did this with both computers without any luck; these drivers were already on the Surface Pro, and were not supported by the Dell laptop. I updated all of the firmware/chipset stuff from the Microsoft website and nothing is rectified.

&#x200B;

I furthermore went so far as to download all of the available software on Elgato's website (besides 4K Capture Utility) and ran those. Interestingly, Game Capture HD detects the device as what it is, with the error, ""Game Capture HD60 S+ is not supported in Game Capture HD,"" then directs me to use the 4K Capture utility software, which is exactly what's been giving me the issues I've already described.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty much at wit's end with this device. What more can I do? Should I return it, if possible?",2022-06-10 01:42:02

I own a children’s activity center business and I would like to live stream a spot in my business that is hard for parent to see. 

The business has very high exposed ceiling and running wire will be very expensive and not look good. (Electritian will need to rent scaffolding can’t use a lift etc)

I would like to instead purchase a hard wired camera (not battery operated )that can reliably live stream to a tv.

I would also like ads to run at the same time on the tv as the live stream.

I have seen this at go cart places. TVs with video showing the gokarters and a border that tracks what lap people are on and an advertisement about snacks at the food shop.

Any ideas on how I can do this?

I have downloaded MirrorMeister and that is pretty close to what I want. This app projected my phone screen to my tv over Wi-Fi and I was recording on my phone and what I was recording was live streamed to the tv. I had the free version so even an advertisement was on my tv at the same time( which I want my own adds just like that) The issue with this is that the image was phone shape (that would not be professional) and the phone would run out of storage space. I do not need to save the video.

I never really have done streaming before, but as a kid I always thought being a Youtuber would be cool! For awhile that interest went away, but recently the idea of streaming popped back into my head. It would be more for fun, and just because, why not stream the games that I play and be able to interact with other people while I play them.

But I am asking if it even makes sense for me to try to, because I wont be playing mainstream and trending games most of the time except maybe Minecraft. Because my computer isnt the best and also I have just been on a run of playing some older games I never finished or want to replay. Some of them might have more of a niche audience or they are just older games.

I am also asking because it wont be one of those things were I live and breathe streaming. It would be something that I do like a couple times a week or on the weekend. So if I am not streaming daily, does that ruin part of the point of doing it?

611,Your gameplay is not important,11,v6ls3v,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/v6ls3v/your_gameplay_is_not_important/,4,"Let me be clear. While gameplay is important to some extent, specifically with competitive games, unless you are literally in the top 0.1% of your game, I promise you your gameplay isn’t a selling point for your stream. 

Instead, the gameplay should be in the background, and you/your brand/your content should be the focus. 

I see so many small streamers fall into the trap of thinking gameplay is the only thing that matters. When you watch other streamers, their game takes up 90% of the screen, so it’s easy to think that viewers are there for the game. They think that if they post a clip of their highlight in apex or cod or valorant, it will bring viewers into their stream. And while that may attract a couple people, the truth is, there’s thousands of streamers who are better at the game than you are. If your viewers wanted to see top tier gameplay, they would go watch the pros. 

I’ve been in these peoples streams. No camera, barely talking, 2 viewers, focusing on the game. I’ll drop in and say hi, and I have to wait 4-5 minutes before they even see the chat message. These are the same people who post on Reddit about how they wanna build a community and become a big streamer some day.

Instead of competing with thousands of streamers on the basis of gameplay alone, show people why they should come to YOUR stream. What makes YOU unique? Why is YOUR channel something they should watch? Don’t fall into the trap. Focus on your content.",2022-06-07 10:50:37

Streaming conditions:
Outdoors, good wind protection, quiet aside from the 8-10 people attending. 2-6 people will be viewing/attending the event.

My main question is around the audio set-up. Does anyone have experience with an event like this? 

1. What microphones would you suggest using? Shotgun, lav, dynamic (sm58 or sm7b), or something else? I have a Scarlett 2i2 interface right now
2. Depending on mic, How would you recommend I set that up?
3. To allow the participants to chat with us, what would you recommend? Having speakers set up? Has anyone had success setting noisegates for external speakers in an outdoor environment (as they would likely have to be relatively loud)?

I’m looking at two encoders; Streamyard which is easy to use and is cloud based so won’t impact performance but there is a fee, which I don’t mind paying to begin easily. And OBS is free but works on system and has a learning curve but might impact stream performance. I will sometimes want to use a green screen background, and show what’s on my monitor screen. Any thoughts on what’s best for a beginner?

I want to stream 1080p 60fps. I have been looking at using my iPhone as a webcam with Reincubate Camo - how well does this actually work, is their lag and is there a way to turn off receiving wifi calls so it doesn’t interrupt the streaming?

Will a Blue Yeti be okay for voice?

So i am a pilot and recently become a drone operator too. I love flying my DJI Air 2S around awesome landmarks and sharing with friends/family. I use an app called Litchi which is used to fly the drone and program it to do all sorts of cool stuff. it has as option to stream to Facebook live but i find that it drops all the time and is unreliable. It has anotehr option to stream to another device so i'm thinking im going to stream point to point to an ipad and then livestream the ipads screen to my streaming platform. Ive played around with OBS a bit but cant seem to get it working quite right. I thought my setup/needs were quite simple but apparently this is more difficult then i thought. 

I wanted to see what people thought would be a good way to stream my ipads screen to Facebook/YouTube/Twitch/etc? I find that alot of the plugins just dont work. I'll install them, set the record to option to the streaming app and even though i'll have my facebook or youtube account configured in the app seemingly correct, nothing ever happens. Im preferably looking for an option that's free as this is just a hobby and not intending on making money off it . I cant imagine how i would monetize me flying a drone around a city anyways, unless i was like dropping water balloons on targets n shit but that crosses a big line of causing harm/damage to people/property on the ground which is one of the biggest no-nos when piloting any type of aircraft. Dropping water balloons is totally legal. U can even hit someone with their permission but the moment it crosses over to an injury of any kind or causes damage, even a little dent to property and ur fucked. lol.

Right now i just want to stream the ipad screen but in the future i might want to consider having some kinda template on the screen with a logo and a video feed of me live talking with anther video feed of the drone, maybe even two different feeds if i can manage to pilot 2 drones at once.

So far ive been streaming directly to Facebook or youtube or twitch. but ive heard that the pro way to go which gives u more flexibility is to stream to a local RTMP server and then broadcast that RTMP feed out to various big platforms like Youtube/Facebook/etc. Does that sound right? What software would i be looking at  for running the RTMP server and for the initial stream where i setup the view/etc?

For those of you who are less familiar with Crowd Control, I just wanted to let you know a bit more about us in case you might want to try it out as it’s free and available for everyone.

Crowd Control is an interactive gaming app that lets your livestream’s viewers take control of the games you play in real-time. Everything is powered by Crowd Control Coins, which users can purchase through Twitch Bits or Channel Points, and even charity donations. Coins can then can be used for all kinds of in-game effects on +80 supported games.

For years we’ve been working on bringing the Crowd Control experience to all platforms and this Multi-Platform beta is the beginning. You can log-in through YouTube, Facebook and Discord but you’re not limited to stream to those platforms as viewers will be able to send effects through a URL. As this beta is mostly a test, sessions will be powered exclusively by Free Coins - all viewers will receive 250 - OR coins acquired by donating to a Tiltify charity campaign.

Over 50,000 Twitch streamers have used Crowd Control and we can’t wait to see streamers from all platforms join in the fun.

He’s asked if he can create a YouTube channel, I don’t want his face to be shown, but I feel like I’m happy for his game play and audio to be able online - but researching before I do.

So I guess my first question is, how can I record full game play with commentary? And my second question would be is there anything I should be aware of, safety wise etc. obviously I won’t be using his full name, he’s clued up on not giving out personal details, I’d obviously review videos first and comments would be off. 

Even if nothing goes online, I’d love to be able to keep the memories of us playing together, something wholesome about him helping me throughout the game play.",2022-06-03 01:55:32

I do mostly worldbuilding streams and table-top gaming stuff. Because my streams are often structured in a way where I cover certain content at certain times during the stream, I'm in need to find a good interactive/responsive widget solution to represent the ""stream schedule/itinerary"" to the viewers.  


Example of a stream of mine with content categories:  
\- 6:00 PM - Just Hanging Out  
\- 6:15 PM - Worldbuilding: Magic Swords  
\- 7:00 PM - Break  
\- 7:15 PM - Dungeons and Dragons Artist Showcase  
\- 8:00 PM - Interview: DMDungeonPro (made-up name as example)  
\- 9:00 PM - Giveaway and Wrap-up  


To be specific about what I mean by news ticker or ""Coming up Next"",... you often see certain news programs or talk shows have a side-bar / topic rotator which tells what topic is **currently active**, what is **up next**, what is **after that**, etc.  


Examples of TV shows that do this:  
1) Rome is Burning - ESPN Show - side of the screen has images representing topics, and a selection-box that moves to highlight which one they are on/talking about.  
2) Pardon the Interruption - ESPN Show - For some reason, ESPN shows seems to have this format down. ... This show has a sidebar with basic topics in a graphical list which are highlighted, and worked down as the show proceeds.  
3) ... SportsCenter... like... wow ESPN does this a lot. ... Just google any of these shows, and you'll know what I mean.  


Any advice, suggestions, and widgets that would help with this?  


(Note: something better than just making a text asset and doing a lot of fumbling and manual moving of JPG graphic assets each stream. someone must have come up with an easier way to execute this.)",2022-06-03 01:09:47

I have a ps4 and switch and I also have a TV but I'm thinking about buying a 10 inch tablet to use as a portable display for my consoles. Essentially a tabletop gaming monitor (idea courtesy of the switch), with added android functionality. I don't plan on recording or anything, just stream the ps4/switch to the tablet's display using the hdmi capture card and the usb camera app. But I'm stuck choosing between 1280x800 and 1920x1200 resolutions for the tablet's screen. Both are 10.1 and 10.3 inches respectively. Here are my questions.

1. The ps4 and switch both output at 1080p, but the capture card forces me to use 720p for 60fps. So would there be any benefit in buying the 1080p screen tablet, or would the 720p tablet be cost effective here? Asking in regards to this specific case scenario.

2. Suppose I buy the 720p screen tablet, should the resolution of the ps4/switch also be changed to 720p by going into the console settings or would I get better picture quality keeping it at 1080p like usual? Keeping in mind the capture card only does 720p.

3. Same question as above, but on the chance I buy the 1080p screen tablet. What resolution should the ps4/switch be set to for the best image on the tablet's display through the 720p capture card? Thanks in advance.",2022-06-02 01:58:34

I had everything set up, I tested it a bunch before starting, I had a virtual chat and easily accessible buttons to troubleshoot, it was going perfectly for about 30 minutes. Then the Steam servers went down, so I put up my “be right back” screen for a minute while I configured everything so it would work again. I unmuted myself and got back into the game when it worked again after about 2 minutes. It went pretty well, I played a nice game, which I think was pretty entertaining to watch me go through as a novice.

After the stream ended, which was about 2 hours, I noticed something that I didn’t notice in VR. I obviously peeked with virtual desktop occasionally to make sure everything was running smoothly, which the viewers couldn’t see, but for some reason I didn’t notice… *I didn’t flip back to gameplay from my “be right back” screen*. The stream was just my audio, and the “be right back” scene for 2 hours. Nothing I did mattered, and it was all a waste. I probably drove some people away, and I can’t recreate it because the charm was me being a novice.

Connect the gear I have to make best possible stream experience and Video recordings. Sometimes watching too many YT channels for advice just spins my head!! 
Please advise..

GOALS :   2 YT channels starting  with videos then streaming live on YT, FB, and Twitch  and Podcasting in future as well.
1st) general kitchen, handy gadget product reviews 2nd) product reviews, advice, how to, for die cutting  machines 

For both at times I need to be up and mobile and to show how I'm doing things.

NOT using OBS for now, but Streamyard and ? Software to connect and tie them all in? Or record to? 

EQUIPMENT:
Canon M50.    GOpro hero5black.     Samsung S20Ultra
 Samsung Tab S6 tablet.   Foscam web cam

HDMI capture card the cheap from Amazon

Wave 3 usb 
Vivitar ( cheap XLR)  
Boyer not Boya cheap mic from Walmart. Seems to work better on my phone with doggle ... I get a low hum on the M50 even when separated from it, when on playback

Streamdeck 15key.     Palette/Monogram large older
                                          Creator kit
Multiple table clamp stands  
Rolling CStand with heavy duty clamps for all goodies needed.
20 different cords to connect just about anything and a couple of doggles too. 

HP pc, too weak I got talked into a 12GB RAM, etc. That I could upgrade later - thus I do very little editing I have a friend helping and  Dell laptop 12 gB older model.

MOST EQUIP IS USED .but work great!.. as an Injured (unpaid work comp fire fighter) I realize you get what you pay for. And my budget is very limited..

☆☆☆☆☆ I plan on buying through ZZounds ( payments)  for what yall recommend.

I will do some talking Head videos but would like to move around as my crafting die cutting machines need to spread out and a key series I'm starting is Clash of the Cutters, as I compare the 3 top brands I was able to aquire 2 years ago. If I decide to stream while using them ..( think of a shop like environment) not as loud as wood working..but you get the idea...

I tried yesterday to connect my M50 with dummy battery with sim card and as soon as I plugged in. Died. 
Camera off I plugged in the USB cord ( goes back into computer too? ) and the HDMI then the camera would turn off. Even when attaching the video card or not...either way it just would shut off used the Utility app. 

Questions
 1) what interface do I need for 3 types of mics? Or the top 2 when guests? The Boyer has a short lil cord I think a TRRS.
I'm looking at Roland Video series interfaces...or do I get a iCloud or GO xlr? Type thingy haha

2) Can I boom the wave 3? And just record separate audio ( I hate this idea) I hate to watch when people's audio doesn't match up perfectly.

3)  do I just get a  long corded lav, and save the Wave3 for podcasting voice over etc. 

4) do I now invest in a boom shotgun mic? 

And again how does all this tie in ? 

Do I create 2 different type set ups? 

I was thinking my go pro And my web cams for room views, maybe my phone for overhead hand shots stationary, or larger table set ups, and Canon for me shots? I Could change any of these of course.

next time I will make sure what I buy can and will work together. I was hugely depressed after I got the wave 3 not working with Canon M50

When I set it so I could listen to the Line Out coming from my streaming PC to my gaming PC, there was a weird static. This static did not leave whatsoever. I tried connecting it directly from PC to PC, I tried using a Go XLR to see if it was my port that was the problem, still happened. I tried multiple fully working cables and got the same result in the end. I even went ahead and got the line out from my monitor and connected it to see if it would do the same thing and found the same result.

Okay, so what do I know so far.  
My streaming PC isn't the problem, my ports aren't broken, I have 2 Line Outs and both do the exact same thing, also I tried connecting an external speaker and got a clean output.

The Cables aren't a problem because I've tested multiple and all are confirmed to be working properly.

My gaming PC isn't the problem, I tried using the Line In port on my PC and connect my switch to it, and worked just fine. The audio was coming clean. Also tried connecting it through the GoXLR's Line In and Outs and still got the same result.

Also, a very weird thing that I noticed, the static changes slightly if I move my mouse around or use the mouse wheel and some other things in my screen, like for example when i grab a tab, it reacts to me moving my tabs, when i use the scroll wheel in a webpage, it also reacts to that, but heres the kicker, ONLY IN THE WINDOW DOES IT REACT TO THAT, so if i use the scroll wheel while being tabbed out of the page, it doesnt react but when im back in the page it starts to react and make noise....  
I don't know at this point 💀

Heres the link to prove im not crazy [https://youtu.be/v0dXgg35SGc](https://youtu.be/v0dXgg35SGc)

The device works, and that's fine - it's just not what I was expecting because I'm a doofus and didn't think too hard before getting it.

My friends and I sit and have streamed PS4 games from the living room using this older laptop (3-4 year old Dell ""gaming"" laptop - not home right now, so I don't know what exactly it is) as a way to monitor and moderate Twitch. We want to do this with PS3 games, too, but there's no built-in Twitch, so I purchased this card expecting to solve the problem. I just created a new one.

&#x200B;

We normally have the games projected onto a big ol' 112"" screen while streaming, but that was when we used the PS4's (admittedly-lackluster) built-in capabilities. I can run OBS on the laptop just fine, but what sucks is that because there's only one ""in"" and one ""out"" on the Elgato, and just one HDMI port on the laptop...clearly this means we have to play on the laptop, where OBS is running, and to where the games are displayed. Not really doable.

&#x200B;

Ideally, we'd have the laptop set with two ""screens"" - its builtin display and the projector display - where the game is displayed on the projector screen and OBS, etc. on the laptop screen.

I need to play from the preview mode of e.g. OBS, so I'm looking for the lowest latency possible (desired \~20ms) when displaying the captured video on a different computer.  
I already found this chart:

But the 42ms delay is still way too high to high to play reaction time required games.  
Does anyone know of a way to lower the latency with like a different software/capturecard.  
Hoping someone can help me out.

I feel like things are against me a bit and I'm looking for whatever advice I can find. My computer is pretty much a potato, but I really want to start Vtubing. I tried using VRoid studio and VSeeFace and Obs started lagging pretty bad, even though I used the minimum for my VRoid avatar (literally it took me like half an hour to reduce the polygons on the avatar as each time I moved the sliders it was taking up to a minute to actually move them!).

At this point, I'm aware my computer can't handle much at all. I have a capture card so I'm thinking of starting with console gaming only - I was trying to play Sound Voltex Clone with my initial testing.

On top of this, my connection is only around 30 down and 6 up, so I think maybe I can aim for 720p60 or failing that 720p30. I'm big into rhythm games so going to do that but also stream other stuff too. My question I guess is:

Is there a decent free program for making a cartoon 2d avatar (preferably animé) I could have near the border of my screen on obs, in the absence of a moving avatar?

Could I use several 2d avatars and quickly switch overlay? For example, have an avatar that is concentrating as standard, then maybe hotkey to switch the avatar to a laughing one so I could make it react and mot just be static? I'm really just getting started and still stress testing my computer, but I'm determined to try this, despite the odds! TIA.",2022-05-28 20:40:54

In the last week, her live image quality has dropped MASSIVELY so that whenever she is on live, her image quality is very grainy.
We've tried everything, she's using the same phone as she always uses, the same internet connection. Speed tests before during and after all show our usual fast connection speed.
Here's the thing though, if she switches to stream on Twitch from the same phone, the quality is perfect.
If she uses a different phone but her same tiktok account, then it degrades the quality.

At this point we can therefore rule out that it's not the device or the Internet connection that's the problem, but her tiktok account itself.
We've checked that she hasn't got data saver accidentally on either.

At this point I'm resorting to conspiracy theories like maybe this is some form of shadow ban, or aggressive tactic to get her to pay for streamer perks or something to 'fix' it.

I already researched the differences between both platforms etc. I create gameplay vids on youtube already so I'll probably record my twitch vods and share them on YT too. I think I got that sorted out. I'm not thinking about money, my aim right now is to just create a small community of people who enjoy the same games I do and have some relaxing time together.

My problem comes from discoverability. It's like... there's no middle ground between those two platforms. Youtube is big and there are a lot more people, and it's better for variety as well... except almost nobody actually streams there, streaming on youtube seems more like an afterthought. On the flipside, majority of people stream on Twitch but the chance of someone stumbling on my stream seems hilariously low exactly because it's so oversaturated. It's either being a fish in a pond where there's no other fish so no one goes fishing there, or being a fish in a pond with a million other fish where it's almost impossible to be fished out. If that analogy makes sense.

So, aside the megathread here on the subreddit, how do you actually advertise yourself? Do you visit other subreddits, chats etc. and just casually drop a hint you're also a streamer of that game? Or you're just trying to be active in those communities and hope you'll get noticed? That doesn't seem... effective. And I absolutely do not want to be ""that guy"" who just drops a link and then magicks away.

Also, I'm polish and I'd like to stream in my native language so self-promo / advertising on english forums, subreddits is pointless for me. They're out of the picture. I tried to search for polish communities of certain games but they're basically nonexistent. It makes everything much more complicated.

Honestly, at this point I'm feeling like I should just start and then pray to our lord and saviour Cthulhu that some lost lambs will find their ways to my streams on accident or something. Idk. I'd really appreciate your thoughts or even pointing me to some info sources etc.",2022-05-25 19:25:57

The channel is very presentation heavy, but usually keeps the focus on the camera and uses a tool to overlay the presentation as picture-in-picture, but not just as a static overlay, but with fancy animations ([example animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LASTN9MbOno&t=39s)).

Does anyone know which animation tool this guy might using for the overlay effects? Or can you recommend a tool that would be able to create similar animations?

*edit:* After looking into this a bit deeper over the last couple of days, I am pretty sure now that he is using Prezi Video as presentation software.",2022-05-23 22:21:36

And i feel like if i dont stream im wasting something and i have this weird feeling that i should do it but at the same time im afraid like what if it doesn’t works out. And i dont really have an interest in anything except for gaming and streaming.

713,XR1 LITE Capture card problems - No 60 fps available and no passthrough,2,uvvnlb,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/uvvnlb/xr1_lite_capture_card_problems_no_60_fps/,0," *Hi there* hope you are well and that you could help me out here, its been a while now that I have been trying to fix this on my own.

I am trying to get my new XR1 Lite capture card to work.

**There are two problems**

1. not able to get passthrough working
2. not able to get 60fps on 1080p (priority problem)

When  I switch to my HDMI input (XR1 lite) instead of my DisplayPort  that is  connected directly to my computer all I can see is my wallpaper pixels  being stretched extremely (see below pictures) after a few seconds I   get a monitor message saying (out of range)

I have used my DisplayPort input and launched OBS and there I can see a normal desktop picture of my XR1 input but...  
I am only getting 30Hz on the XR1 lite and thus I am unable to get 60fps going for recording.

Could it be my monitor that is unable to work with the XR1?   
Its a G-sync monitor 175Hz (LG 38GL950G monitor)

* **Things I have tried**  
Changing HDMI cables  
Updated the firmware to the latest for XR1  
Made sure I have the latest GPU drivers installed  
Made sure windows updates are all done
* **My PC specs**  
GPU: 2080 Ti  
CPU: i7 5930K  
Motherboard: x99 deluxe Asus

**Thanks for your time and help**

I have the [cheap Neewer microphone arm and pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Microphone-Suspension-Mounting-Windscreen/dp/B01GRMF5ZE) for my AKG Lyra and the arm works great, but the pop filter is a pain.  It seems to have just a few positions it really wants to sit in when adjusting it, it can get really difficult to get it to stay where I actually want it.

So I wanted to replace the pop filter with a better one, but when I search for them it seems like most of the universal ones look pretty much identical.  I wasn't sure which one to trust, especially since I see that the Neewer one has good reviews so I don't want to just judge based on the Amazon reviews.  Anyone have one that will work for my mic/arm and is good about simply moving it and staying in place wherever you let it go?

On the gaming PC I'm currently using the clone display to duplicate my main display to the capture card. This works with 99% of games except CSGO. With csgo only I'm experiencing what I would describe as input lag/poor registration. Again only with csgo alt tabbing causes my pc to freeze for 2-3seconds and opening and closing csgo causes a similar freeze. These freezes are only present when the clone display is enabled. Gaming PC is a 5900x, 32gb ram and a 2070s, hitting no where near any of its performance limits, and the only important part of the streaming pc is the elgato 4k mk2. Running csgo in 1080p at 144hz(and the capture card at 144hz). CSGO is also the only game I play which causes the elgato to momentarily loose signal when launching. 

I'm wondering if theres some setting be it in windows or nvidia control panel, someway to set the elgato up correctly maybe the display scaling? Some driver or something missing. I see plenty of other people streaming cs so is there something simple I've just overlooked? Maybe a setting on the elgato on the stream pc? Happy to provide any information about settings ask away.

This is a long standing problem I've experienced and a problem which has sustained after I've upgraded hardware. (entire new gaming pc)

Mic is priority

streamlabs is set as high priority

Mic is correctly configured in streamlabs

i have recently turned on exclusive mode after it being off, and no fix

hi! I'm a twitch streamer, and I have a blue snowball that is starting to disconnect on and off making it harder to stream. I have enough funds to get either one of these so price nor desk space is an issue, and it doesn't matter if it requires a learning curve as I'm a fast learner, but I just wanted to get opinions.

 should I get one of the more premium USB mics like the elgato wave 3, or a professional studio mic + mixer/audio interface setup(currently looking at either the audio technica at2020, or the rode podmic.)

\- They're not affiliate yet, and I'm still a small streamer, so gifting subs (or any other monetary bet) is a no go because we wouldn't benefit much out of it.

I DID read somewhere online I can use My GPU AND CPU in conjunction with each other, e.g. Use CPU for the livestream, GPU for Recording or even GPU for Streaming and CPU for the Recording, so that's why I opted for the cheapest, but fastest NVIDIA GPU that has NVENC.

Framerate: 60fps

Bitrate: 6000kbps(As per Twitches maximum)

# Recording

Resoloution: 1080p(when using my High End Windows XP Gaming PC), 1440p(At Present), 4k(In hopefully the nearby future)

I can capture my screen without any lag now but the text and the sizing of the app is way off now. The text is too big and gets cropped, The black screen that displays what your viewers see is too small. I checked the obs settings and everything was set to 1080p. I guess the black sceen could just look different in 1080p but the text being too big and cropped doesent make sense. Can someone help me figure out how to make obs app normal at 1080p?

A bit more cumbersome but at least I can get it done and not miss anything because I forgot to clip it mid stream.

Problem is, I tried this, and the file size is so huge stream ladder grinds to a hault trying to compress and format it.

**I don't have enough desk space for this.**

I use my desk to work from home, and that makes use of most of the desktop. The display riser holds two monitors, I have a phone on the left, and mouse and keyboard in the middle. There's two shelves underneath where I have the computer tower and powerstrip. When I stream on my laptop, I can use the middle desktop space if I tuck the work mouse and keyboard under the display riser.

However, that's not enough room for the microphone, Switch dock, capture card, much less an additional monitor. I'd use one of the work monitors but that's too many wires as it is. 

What's the most practical solution here? Should I get a second surface to store things, invest in one of those microphone arms? Or just write off console streaming till I'm living somewhere I can put a second desk?

Razer Book - Full HD 60Hz - Intel® Iris® Xe
Graphics - Pink Quartz

one is intel core i5 and the other is intel core i7

the i5 is $1063 with tax and the i7 is $1435.71

Should I save the extra few hundred dollars or should I just get the i7? thanks in advance!",2022-05-13 23:23:14

Setup

* 1 PC
* 2 monitors
* 1 camera

&#x200B;

What i am looking for is streaming on discord (or other but private) to friends what my camera sees (will be aimed at a tabletop game on a table) and at the same time the screen of an app running on the PC. So we can play board games together on my table even if i'm alone at home while they are watching the streamed content.

Optimally i'm looking for a free solution even if the features are limited. I won't be streaming often and I will do it to 5 people max.

Since I have only one camera, I don't plan on showing my face (it is also not needed for what i'm doing)

I'm planning to do some online lottos, like Bingos (specifically Mexican Lotería) to help me pay for my health issues. This is perfectly legal where I live, just to clarify. 
I'm planning to show the board on a main screen, and a secondary screen (like those add-ons on twitch that shows extra information, like the live chat and other meaningful information, like picture in picture) showing the app I use for the draws so it's completely transparent and trustworthy for anyone that plays and buys numbers.

The actual game goes like this: Mexican Lotería is composed of a set of 54 different ""cards"", each with a number, a picture and a name. I build boards (in photoshop, I'm thinking) with at least 25 cards picked at random. Players buy each one a card, and its unavailable for others to buy that same card, and its bound to them. When I do the draw, each card picked by the app is ""burnt"", and the last card remaining wins the pot.

I have no specific hardware or anything. I'm not sure if I should/could go that extra mile, taking into consideration that this is meant mostly for family members and friends. I do have a windows laptop, capable of running pretty much anything, some midrange android phones and a Samsung tablet. The treatment lasts for a year I guess, so that's the amount of time that I'm planning on doing this. If it goes well, I'm most likely investing on it and keeping it going. 

Honestly it's the first time I've streamed or done anything like this, so any tips and information will be much appreciated.

Thanks a lot.",2022-05-13 12:55:46

I'm thinking it would make for a good dedicated streaming PC, so that I don't put any additional load on my main gaming PC, which has the following specs:- Ryzen 5 3600- RX 6700XT- 16GB DDR4- SSD

If I were to use the older PC to encode/stream/record, would I have any issues with the gaming PC being an AMD GPU while the streaming PC would be an nVidia GPU? I've read that nVidia is far better for encoding/streaming, but I guess I'm just curious if my proposed setup would work OK or if anything would be problematic with this setup. I was thinking I'd get myself a gigabit switch and use NDI to avoid having to buy a capture card.

I also have a YouTube channel and frequently record gaming footage at 1080p 60fps. I'd be curious if there's a way to record using something like OBS and make the dedicated PC with the nvidia GPU do the encoding so my main gaming PC's older processor doesn't take the hit with H264?

Whenever I try to stream any of the Tomb Raider Trilogy games, my streams game capture immediately freezes or lags so severely, it's basically frozen anyways. I run a dual pc setup, and have not had this issue with any other game like Cyberpunk, Dark Souls 3, Elden Ring, or any other main stream title. I got the trilogy off the Epic Games store sale when they were free, so idk if that has something to do with it. Oddly enough, the games audio still comes through clear and unfrozen, you can hear everything happening, but the game capture itself is just frozen or practically frozen. 

I've also tried running a stream on SLOBS for them just on my game PC which has an r5 5600x and a 6600xt gpu, but still has the same issues occur. The only other game this happened with was Final Fantasy XV, but after extensive reading it seems as though that was simply a really sh177y port problem to Steam that is still occurring to this day.

I'm currently undergoing a bit of a rebrand for my twitch channel and could use some thoughts. A little background info, I've been an on and off streamer for the past few years, made affiliate awhile back and was thrilled, however, I felt that my content wasn't the best it could be and life got in the way so I stopped. One of the best things in my life happened and my son was born and everything else has taken a backseat.

Well, I think it's officially time for my return. I began brainstorming and Ultimately decided that I just don't really have the time to focus on competitive games anymore, so what if instead of focusing on gameplay, I focused on building a character. Not in a game however, but in real life.

My new moniker, Stereotypical_Dad, will be focused on all of that typical dad jokey content. I'll be rocking some sports shades, Jorts, fanny packs, and of course, the crisp ever-so comfy White New Balance shoes.

I figured this would give me a chance to do more IRL streams and let me take advantage of doing things I love outside of gaming, like, going fishing, grilling, etc. But it would also provide me with the chance to create this total goof of a character that I can have fun developing.

What do you think??

Im starting out only recording my gameplay and uploading it to youtube with the goal of live streaning in the future. Also I'm exclusively recording sports simulations. (Ex: Madden CPU vs Madden CPU) so high res video quality is top priority for my channel.

Rn I have a Series x, connected to a 4K Monitor and I'm trying to record it on a laptop using OBS. My laptop is a bit outdated i assume. It's a Dell Inspiron 5,000 series with a 1080P screen. (About 5 years old) I started out trying to record with the XBox app remotely to my laptop. (No capture card) But it was super laggy no matter what i did with the settings. I recently purchased a capture card and plan on trying to incorporate that with the setup. The problem is I don't know if the capture card is going to make a difference given my laptop being a bit outdated and only having a 1080P screen. 

Should I invest in a new laptop? Does the laptops screen resolution limit what resolution i can record in? Would the capture card make that big of a difference and help with the OBS lag when playing back my recordings? Would you recommend recording at a lower than 4K resolution?

Any tips or advice in general would be greatly appreciated. Also if you'd recommend a new laptop my budget is preferavly around $1200 or less. Thanks in advance.

MORE DETAIL/LAPTOP AND CAPTURE CARD SPECS:

When I record using the XBox remote play, during the actual recording process everything looks fairly smooth. But when i stop recording and go to watch the recording, the gameplay is very glitchy/choppy throughout. It goes back and forth from looking clear and smooth for a few secs then it'll be choppy the next few secs. When it's actually recording though, it usually looks smooth the entire time.

As for my capture card... I just bought the ASUS TUF Gaming Video Capture Card (CU4K30) 4K/2K/1080P 120 FPS & HDR Passthrough, Near-Zero Latency, Certified for OBS, USB 3.2, Plug & Play, Record & Stream with PC, PS5, Xbox, Switch.

I am not an English speaker, I use Google Translate.

I have a problem with a chroma cloth, streamlabs and my beard.

It turns out that once I have it all set up, moving the settings for the chroma color turns everything black.

When I go out and put on a game, it looks good, the background is transparent, but so is my beard!

Someone else happens? Could it be due to poor chroma lighting?

I am using green chroma.

In the attached image you can see how the background turns black while you configure the color of the chroma and its attributes.

What's most efficient setup?,2,ui8j75,streaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/streaming/comments/ui8j75/building_a_mobile_batterypowered_live_stream_box/,12,"What I am doing is very complicated and I know normal streaming tools will not work because I want to live stream to multiple platforms and merge multiple GoPro Hero10s into one stream and it must be done wirelessly. I plan on creating a complete guide for all of this when I am done so others can easily do what I am trying to do. I assume no one has done what I am attempting to do.

&#x200B;

What is the most efficient method per watt? Is it CPU, GPU, AIC, or something else? I will be stuck using 4G/5G data via tethering since I will be in remote areas without wifi/landline connection. I think the best-case scenario is I get a 30-50Mbps upload. So I will have limited bandwidth so sending uncompressed data is not an option. I will be using 2 GoPro Hero10s at first but eventually will be using 4 GoPro Hero10s. I also want to stream cross-platform to YouTube/Oddessey/DTube and so on. I want to make sure I am live streaming to the alternative platforms that don't have censorship. So I assume I will also need a streaming server.

Ideally, I'll be live streaming at 1080p 60hz and merging the 2-4 streams into a single 4K60hz stream so viewers will be able to see 2-4 angles of what I am doing at once in a single stream. I assume I'll have to send the 2-4 streams via wifi to the streaming box for processing into a single stream and then through 4G/5G data to a streaming server that will send the single stream to the various platforms (Youtube/Oddessy/DTube/Twitch/or whatever).

&#x200B;

**Stream Box Requirements**\*Support portable touch screen monitor via DP/USB/HDMI (DP preferred I think. It has latches so the cable is less likely to come out)WIFI would be best but I don't know if a product like that exists yet. If you know of a portable wifi monitor I am all ears.\*Adlar Lake lake NUC/ITX or 16+ core Ryzen ITX or AIC or whatever\*USB PD or DC power\*enough power to support 4x1080P streams to Youtube/Oddessy/whatever. The goal is to make the 2-4x1080p GoPro Hero10 streams into a single 4K stream, which I believe is possible.\*will probably use 4G/5G tethering for data\*system should use no more than 100 Wh for processing

&#x200B;

I will be building a custom 400-800 Wh battery back to power this so I will get about 4-8 hours of run time.

&#x200B;

How much processing power do I need to get decent-quality streams? What setup has the best performance per watt? I know I can get near 100% performance out of an Intel 1260P and \~80% from a 12900K with proper undervolting/underclocking. I am well experienced with this. The same goes for Ryzen CPUs I probably could get more performance from a 16 Ryzen with undervolting and running at 3+/- GHz frequency. CPUs are most efficient at the 2-3GHz range and power skyrockets when you break 3 GHz.

I can give data, sources, and examples on this if needed.

&#x200B;

So would an undervolted 1260P at 100% or 12900K at 80% performance be sufficient or would an undervolted 16 Ryzen running at 3+/- Ghz be enough or are there more efficient options like using a GPU or AIC for this? Remember I want to stay at around 100 watts per hour for this. I also assume I will be lucky if I get a consistent 30-50 Mbps upload.

&#x200B;

**What are your thoughts? What route should I go? Any recommendations and advice are appreciated! If you have any recommendations for software, tools, guides, or whatever. I would greatly appreciate it!**

&#x200B;

Can I post links to sources, reviews, data, and products? Some reddits are dumb and you get instantly banned for that so it's confusing and makes no sense and I don't want to get banned for something silly like that. Thanks.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** If I have multiple GoPro Hero10s connect wireless to a streambox. Does the streambox need 1 wifi card per GoPro? Or do I need a wifi router that all the GoPros connect to and route their data to the streambox? I am unsure how multiple GoPros work. Thanks",2022-05-04 21:59:15

Hi all!
  I’ve put a fair amount of research into this and beginning to wonder if I need to temper my expectations.  I have only tested it out with Warzone and Halo Infinite, but I notice once the game starts moving, it gets blurry (with varying severity). It is at its worst during warzone when running through foliage. I have done numerous things but was wondering if in 2022 there was any new guidance. Hopping in on other peoples streams, it does seem like this is a pretty widespread occurrence.  I am not affiliated/partnered.  Here are some things I have tried:

1) adjusted bitrate.  Started at 6000 and now sit at 7000. I THINK I’ve seen an improvement but it was minor  and I understand going too high might be bad. 
2) adjusted base/canvas resolutions.  I game on a 1440 but have tried everything in terms of base/canvas combinations (always downscaling of course.  Lanzco and bicubic seem to make no appreciable difference. 
3) quality vs max quality.  Not sure this mattered.  
4) I have a gigibit connection through Verizon so pretty awesome speeds.  Hardwired 

I have NOT adjusted FPS only because I was originally streaming at 30 and consistently didnt look great so I am at 60. 

I think my biggest issue is that there are so many combinations of things you can do and not sure if there is one catered to my specific situation. Most research points to the above adjustments but I’m getting those quality drops.  Am I maybe just expecting too much? Are all streamers of any experience/level seeing this sort of thing?

The only problem is sending the OBS strem back to the Web Presenter: Will I be able to forward the converted SDI stream from the Web Presenter to OBS and from OBS back to the Web Presenter over the same USB cable? Or should I directly stream from OBS and let my PC do the encoding?

So I just started properly streaming and finished a massive editing session of a 3 hour stream (Cut down to roughly 120 minutes and then cut to be uploaded to youtube in 3 parts). I loved adding sound effects and what not to make it more entertaining which I'm really happy how it turned out. But it actually took quite a long time to finish and ended up quite restless. Not saying I didn't enjoy it, it was amazing fun but I feel adding all the effects instead of just cutting the video and uploading it really took it out of me. But in saying that, I feel the current way I'm tackling this does add a large amount of quality to the playthrough.

I took a look at a few other channels and found they upload a lot of smaller clips from their VOD/Stream and then add other stuff to those which looks much, much more manageable. And their VODS just seem to be cut down.

The thing that gets me is I aim to stream Tuesdays and Thursdays and I don't want to end up with a pile of VODS that I can't catch up to.

Should I just add sound effects and silly stuff to the clips or should I just push through with my current strategy? How do you guys do it?",2022-04-28 21:57:01

I wanted to release it the right way and couldn't find how/which services offer this. I've asked my current distribution labels and they think it's impossible which I know it isn't. 

2nd concern is someone else claiming a copywrite for the music i want to release in public domain. So I assume I would need to ""Release"" the track to tie it to my name and select to have it released as royalty free so streamers and content creators won't get flagged for using it and risk getting demonetized. 

Similar thing I've seen was StreamBeats which is a great thing he is doing.

My keys, my mouse clicks, birds chirping, dogs barking, the rumbling of cars going past. I thought that setting up a compressor and noise gate would fix this issue, and while it helped a little my keys and clicks can still be heard. I spent over an hour changing the position of my mic and fiddling with other bits, googling fixes etc, but I couldn't find a position/setting that I liked.

A little context about me. I'm 38M. I suffered a heart attack 2 years ago and a mild stroke a the same year. I was recommended to get an angioplasty asap but due to financial issues, I couldn't do it. I was unemployed afterwards for a year then I was able to work again. In that recent employment, I loved working again however later on, I felt the same numbing pain in my chest which made it hard for me to breath yet again. So I went to the doctor. The doctor told me the same thing the doctors years ago said, that I need to get an angioplasty done. This eventually led me to be let go from my job again. 

The only thing that made my adult life fun was working with numbers and working with spreadsheets but unfortunately, due to my condition, the chance of me going back to it is getting farther and farther away. I remembered when I was younger (before the spreadsheets and numbers), I used to love watching people play games on youtube. I would love to do it too but I didn't think I have the same hand/eye coordination I had when I was younger. 

I'm thinking of trying it now since I have nothing to go back to (I'm not planning of getting an angioplasty due to the possibility of getting buried in medical bills) and I'm already fine with dropping de*d anytime in the future. I'll just try going back to what I liked the most when I was younger. My question is do you have any tips that I can start working on? Also, I'm not planning of becoming a big streamer like mr disrespect or timthetatman. I'll just go with the flow. If people watch, great. If they don't, at least, I'm still enjoying.

Right now I have a EOS RP with kit lenses and 50mm f1.8 lenses. Both lenses are not getting the job done. the kit lenses has really high aperture for bokeh, and the 50mm f 1.8 lenses has a high focal point for my small 9x9 room, so I look REALLY zoomed in.

Can you please recommend me a lenses that would have the correct aperture and focal length for my setup? thank you!",2022-04-22 04:00:28

I toyed around with a service a while back (I don't recall the name offhand - multistream?) that allowed me to Stream to Twitch and YouTube simultaneously, but I didn't do much with it. I also recall issues with having a ""centralized"" chat - I use OBS, and (for example), I'd have to just use one ""main"" chat (like Twitch) and neglect the others, or have several small chat ""windows"" in OBS.

Is there any way for chat from each of these services to be combined somehow? Maybe a Discord bot or something?

Without the multiple elements my stream has, it runs smoothly on my main. Specs below. However, I'd like to use all my elements lossless. I see a significant frame drop @720p 60fps when multiple are active. 

I'd prefer to use a laptop due to space, however I don't want to break the bank on a high-end gaming laptop to do it. Idk. Just looking for suggestions on a laptop that would suffice performance wise, or a slim pre built that would handle it.

Current PC specs. 
I7-10700k
3060ti -msi gaming (2 fan)
32gb ddr4 3200mhz ram

Obs settings/elements
Base rez 1920-1080p
Output 720p 60fps
Hand cam/keyboard
Monitor camera
Face camera
Game capture
Onscreen scrolling text
Custom non animated overlay
Custom stinger transitions
4+ scenes with auto switch

If possible, link any pc/laptop from Amazon/etc worth a look. 
Anything under 500$ usd is appreciated 👍

Edit:  So, must be stated.  I currently DO use a 2nd pc (my wifes) with NDI through OBS, but her GPU is my old RX570, and she only has a quad-core processor.

I recently purchased a Roland VT-4 for use over Discord and streaming, specifically to alter my voice for D&D and other TTRPGs. It's working, however I've noticed that if I have computer audio on in the background, such as music, I will also transmit my computer audio over Discord as well.

I'm trying to prevent this computer audio transmission from happening, especially since the games I run tend to have lots of computer audio such as music and sound effects. I can do this by connecting my headphones directly to my computer instead of through the VT-4, however then I can't hear my voice effects as they're happening.

I'm currently running on a Macbook Pro 2018, OS11.6.5 (Big Sur), and using a AT2020 condenser mic connected through an XLR cable to the VT-4.
